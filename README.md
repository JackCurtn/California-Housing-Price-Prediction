# California-Housing-Price-Prediction
Assignment as part of a Machine Learning module for Business Analytics at the University of Limerick

This project involved creating a synthetic dataset and notablely looking at a dataset containg prices of Californian Houses.

I created functions to:
- Plot scatterplots for the various features in both datasets
- Plot comparisons of outliers before and after outlier methods had been used
- Print accuracy scores for each outlier method used to compare with the 'untouched' data
- Plot the K-Classification with regards to Training and Test accuracy
