# California-Housing-Price-Prediction
Assignment as part of a Machine Learning module for Business Analytics at the University of Limerick

This project involved creating a synthetic dataset and notably looking at a dataset containing prices of Californian Houses.

I created functions to:
- Plot scatterplots for the various features in both datasets
- Plot comparisons of outliers before and after outlier methods had been used
- Print accuracy scores for numerous modelling methods and subsequently each outlier method used
- Plot the K-Classification with regards to Training and Test accuracy
